##Convention
* "+" = blow
* "-" = draw
* '  = halfstep bend
* "  = whole step bend
* "' = 3 halfsteps bend
* +X? = overblow
* -X? = overdraw
* "<" = slide

Bends, over blow, over draw may be supported if it's the only way to play the note.
If there are two holes for one note, a choice has been made (draw)
